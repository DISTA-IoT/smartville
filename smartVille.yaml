# SmartVille Configuration

intrusion_detection:
  eval: false  # Whether to use neural modules in evaluation mode (no training)
  device: 'cpu'  # Can be 'cpu' or 'cuda:0', 'cuda:1', etc. Depending on hw availability
  seed: 777  # A fixed initial seed for random sampling and storing in the experience buffer
  ai_debug: true  # A boolean flag for a verbose version of ML related code
  multi_class: true  # A boolean flag indicating if the ML classifier should perform multi-class classification
  use_packet_feats: true  # Use first bytes of first packets of each flow alongside flowstats to build feature vectors
  packet_buffer_len: 1  # If 'use_packet_feats'=True, indicates how many packets are retained from each flow to build feature vectors
  flow_buff_len: 10  # Indicates the flowstats time-window size to build feature vectors
  node_features: false  # Use node features to build the feature vectors
  metric_buffer_len: 10  # If 'node_features'=True, node features time-window size to build feature vectors
  inference_freq_secs: 60  # Time in seconds between two consecutive calls to an inference (and a batch training from experience buffer)
  grafana_user: 'admin'  # Username for the Grafana dashboard (Must coincide with grafana config files, default config files are at usr/share/grafana in the controller)
